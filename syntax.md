# Python Syntax

## Syntax Rules
### Python is case sensitive. 
Some programming languages are case sensitive with to their identifiers (variable, and function name for example)
So, in Python a variable with the name `a`, and another with the name `A`, are two different things in Python.

To try and illustrate this open the terminal and start Python
```bash
$ python
>>> a = 1
>>> A = 2
>>> print(a)
1
>>> print(A)
2
```
If this was a language that was not case sensitive, then `a` and `A` would both be equal to 2.
